# Quick Start

This guide will get you up and running with warrior-bot in minutes.

## Basic Usage

warrior-bot (or `wb` for short) provides several commands to help you navigate WSU resources.

### Finding People or Places

Use the `where` command to find people or locations:

```bash
wb where naresh mahabir
```

### Navigating to Resources

Use the `go` command to quickly access WSU resources:

```bash
wb go degree works
```

### Booking Facilities

Use the `book` command to reserve spaces:

```bash
wb book --b state hall
```

## Command Aliases

You can use either the full command name or the short alias:

- `warrior-bot` or `wb`

Both work exactly the same way!

## Getting Help

For any command, you can add `--help` to see available options:

```bash
wb --help
wb go --help
wb where --help
wb book --help
```
