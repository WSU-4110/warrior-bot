## Terminal Recommendations

For the best experience, we recommend using a modern terminal emulator:

- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)
- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/binary/)
- [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org/index.html)

On macOS, [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is the defacto standard.
